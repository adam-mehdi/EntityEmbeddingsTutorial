# EntityEmbeddingsTutorial
This tutorial will be useful if you:
  - wish to learn about using entity embeddings from trained neural networks in machine learning algorithms.
  - are looking for a pipeline that converts categorical columns in a structured dataset into a continuous representation.

In this walkthrough, I represent categorical variables with embeddings from a trained neural network. We cover everything from loading the data to inference using embedded data. I wrote a [concomitant article](https://towardsdatascience.com/entity-embeddings-for-ml-2387eb68e49) with more details about the motivation for this project and theory on entity embeddings.
